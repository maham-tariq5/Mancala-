# Overview

A text UI based Mancala game using OOP concepts. The pit class is used to manage and represent the individual pits on the game board. Players can add stones to pits, get the current stone count in a pit, and remove all stones from a pit. The Player class is used to represent and manage the two players in the game. It stores their names, their individual stores where they collect stones etc. The Store class represents a player's store in the Mancala game. It keeps track of the number of stones in the store and the owner (player) of the store. The board class is responsible for representing the game board, managing the distribution of stones, handling capture conditions, and providing methods to query the state of the board during a game of Mancala. Lastly, the MancalaGame class serves as the core controller for a Mancala game. It manages the game board, player actions, game state, and win conditions.
