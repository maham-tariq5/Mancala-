1. Are the variable and method names meaningful and descriptive? Give specific examples to support your observation. How could the variable and method names be improved?

I would say for the most part the variable and method names are meaningful and are descriptive enough for someone else to interpret. Some examples of this could be moveStones(int startPit, Player player) suggests moving stones starting from a given pit.
isGameOver(Player[] players) gives an indication that it checks if the game is over. There are also things that could be improve though such as the distributeStones method. I think this could be renamed to something like distributeStonesFromPit for more clarity. Also, in the player class, getStoneCount() method might be a bit misleading as we're actually fetching stones from a store. getStoreStoneCount() would be clearer.


2. Does the code follow coding conventions and formatting standards? Has it made appropriate use of includes? Are static members used properly?

I would say the code follows most conventions reasonably well. The code follows conventions reasonably well with a consistent use of indentation, spacing, and camelCase naming. No static members are used or misused in the code provided. There could be some improvements though such as Some comments like // You can add pits as needed seem redundant and can be removed. There are extra blank lines in the code which could be removed to maintain formatting consistency.

3. Are the classes properly encapsulated? Are member variables private? Are accessor and mutator methods used?

The classes display a decent level of encapsulation. Most member variables are private and are accessed via accessor methods.
Examples:
Board class has private lists pits and stores which is good.
Player class's name and store variables are private with public getters and setters. It could also benefit from some improvements though such as in the Board class, the methods like getPits() and getStores() could potentially break encapsulation by exposing the internal lists directly. It's better to return unmodifiable views of these lists or deep copies. The setCurrentPlayer(Player player) method in MancalaGame could potentially allow external classes to disrupt the game logic. Consider if this needs to be public or if the logic to switch players should be encapsulated within the class.

4. Is there any duplication of code in this project? Are there methods that do essentially the same thing, or parts of the same thing that could be made into smaller methods?

There's no blatant repetition where code blocks are copied and pasted. Each method and class seems to have its unique role. In the TextUI class, the runGame() function takes on many tasks, from initializing players to running the game loop and wrapping up the game. Breaking it into smaller, focused methods could make it clearer. When fully fleshed out, the move method in MancalaGame and its counterpart moveStones in Board might encompass complex logic. If so, segmenting them into more specific helper functions might be beneficial.

5. Does each class and method have a single, obvious purpose or responsibility? Are there any long methods that should be broken up into smaller methods? Give specific examples of how you could improve the code with respect to responsibilities

I would say for the most part all the classes clearly have their own responsbilties like Board: Represents the Mancala game board. This seems well-defined. MancalaGame: Manages the flow of the game, including maintaining the current player. While it fits its responsibility, it acts as a bridge between the UI and the Board and may grow complex over time.Pit: Represents a single pit in the game and its number of stones. Its responsibility is clear etc. 

runGame() in TextUI: This method initializes players, runs the game loop, prints game results, and determines the game's end. It's handling multiple stages of the game. This method could be broken down. For example, you could have separate methods like initializePlayers(), playGame(), and printResults().


6. Functionality and Correctness

There are alot of incomplete functionalites in the AI code such as methods like setUpPits(), setUpStores(), initializeBoard(), moveStones(), etc., are placeholders without specific code inside them. There is no logic to handle invalid moves, such as choosing an empty pit or a pit that doesn't belong to the current player. The relationship between Player and Store is appropriately established with each player having a store. The move(int startPit) function in MancalaGame interacts with the moveStones(int startPit, Player player) function in Board. This separation of game logic and game flow is a correct approach, but the implementation is not fleshed out. The method setCurrentPlayer(Player player) allows for setting any player as the current player, without validation. This might cause issues if a non-participant (i.e., someone other than the two defined players) is mistakenly set as the current player.
